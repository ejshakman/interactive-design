## WeatherVoyeur

Created at Knox College in Interactive Design Spring 2024, WeatherVoyeur is a playful and imaginative faux weather site. It features news headlines with catchy wordplay, a shop offering outlandish products, and a creative interpretation of a Search page. The design subtley modernizes mid-2000s web aesthetic.
